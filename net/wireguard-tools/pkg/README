| Running WireGuard on OpenBSD
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rc.d(8) script
===============
The included rc.d script is limited to supporting a single instance of
WireGuard. Create your configuration with a .conf extension in /etc/wireguard
and add the name of your configuration to wireguard_flags in
/etc/rc.conf.local. The rc.d script supports both reloading the configuration
during runtime and monitoring the run state of the daemon.

For example, for a configuration file named wg0.conf, the file should be
located at:

    /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

The configuration file should have the appropriate permissions and ownership:

    # chmod 0400 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
    # chown root:wheel /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

The system daemon configuration database should be updated to start the
WireGuard daemon with the name of the configuration:

    # echo 'wireguard_flags="wg0"' >> /etc/rc.conf.local

The daemon can then be controlled using normal rc.d mechanisms:

    # /etc/rc.d/wireguard start
